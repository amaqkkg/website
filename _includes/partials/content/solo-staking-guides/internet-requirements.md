You *do not* have to have 100% uptime in order to stake at home. Offline penalties are extremely minor - you only lose the equivalent of what you would have made had the node been online. And youâ€™ll never get slashed for being offline.

|          | Minimum Requirements
-----------|---------------------
Speeds     | 10 Mbps up & down
Bandwidth  | 2 TB per month on the high end. Minimal setups can reduce this to under 1 TB*
Connection | Ethernet (not recommended to run over wifi)
Autonomy   | You will want administrative access to your router

\* *<small>You can minimize bandwidth requirements by minimizing peers or making sure your open ports are correctly configured. It may be suboptimal performance but it will still be profitable.</small>*
